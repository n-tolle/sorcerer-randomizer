If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork this repository and propose your changes via a Pull Request.

You can install the project's dependencies by going to the root directory of the project and running `npm install`.

Feel free to install, use, and modify your copy of this repo.  The only requirement I have is that any distribution of this or modified versions of this should be free.  I do not believe anything in this repo would violate trademarks or copyrights, but if you intend to deploy this for public consumption I would recommend getting permission from the game's publisher first.

## Future Plans

You may have noticed that there are options for using the Endbringer scenario and solo games which currently lead to coming soon screens.  This is due to the fact that I am not yet aware of all of the different nemesis, archetypes, and scenarios included with Endbringer and do not like partial lists and solo is only available for play with the Endbringer scenarios.  I will update these as time permits once I have the relevant information, but feel free to make these changes yourself to your forked copy if you would like.
