Feel free to install, use, and modify your copy of this repo.  The only requirement I have is that any distribution of this or modified versions of this should be free.  I do not believe anything in this repo would violate trademarks or copyrights, but if you intend to deploy this for public consumption I would recommend getting permission from the publisher first.

## Future Plans

Currently there is no database to persist data.  This was originally developed for my own use and was not important for me at the time.  I do plan to add a database to persist data and refactor the code to use this database and make the overall app nicer looking and easier to use.  However, I do not have a deadline for completing or working on this portion at the moment.

You may also have noticed that there are options for using the Endbringer scenario and solo games which currently lead to coming soon screens.  This is due to the fact that I am not yet aware of all of the different nemesis, archetypes, and scenarios included with Endbringer and do not like partial lists and solo is only available for play with the Endbringer scenarios.  I will update these as time permits once I have the relevant information, but feel free to make these changes yourself to your forked copy if you would like.
